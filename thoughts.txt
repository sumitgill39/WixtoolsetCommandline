now we need to foucs on creating the organisational level of professional application where are can offer different type of   
  creating the msi, as of now we have figured out that we can create Number of application packaging WebAPP, WindowsServer,     
  Website based msi.\
  Now First we need to create great professional prompt for yourself to create such application by observing my thoughts of     
  steps first. Then you can share yours.\
  \
  Application Logging : A central application which has an anuthentication system by connecting the application to different    
  doamins in orgarnisation. As user tried to login if he\she apporoved user he can login into the application, but if the user  
   tried to login and he\she is not approved then it will get the request form to fill the request and submit it and Admin of   
  the application will approve the user access request. In the request form it need to have few items like What application     
  againts they need access they need to share AppShort Key and the app need to get verified using API of other application and  
   once the application verified that given name is availble in other application and submit the request access to Admin.\      
  Central Dashboard : As user logging into the application it will get the a very professional dashboard about the user login   
  profile where they add their profile Pic and they will get thier first name and middle name and last name. Then if user       
  logged into frist time after the approval it get blank with onboarding the project details against which they have raised     
  the request. But now it could be possible that a single user can be part of multiple project (appshort keys), but at the      
  time of request they should have atleast one project. Now when user select the among which project they need to create        
  select what what type of component its website, webapp, windows service, task scheduler, etc type will be added laster as     
  user demand. Now each component has a unique ID like guid ID which will also get stored in Product.wxs after that it need to  
   share some information like against how many envrionments its has like DEV,QA,UAT,PREPROD,PROD,SIT,DR and against each       
  envrionment what are the servers (this needs to be a drop down and get the values from servicenow API as user type name it    
  need to fillterout the same if the server name is not vaild then prompt the error) its possible that user can select
  multiple servre it could be possible for aaplications like using HPC which have serval node for proccessing. then it need to  
   share from which location application will get the artifacts to make them msi like Jfrog URL path where user can set
  polling frequency to check if their is new zip file is being uploaded by Github action, aaplication should have feature like  
   where they can configure multiple links of jfrog cause that possibility that if primiary link goes down then it can check    
  the other links. from the primary link it need to dowload the latest artifacts and then based on the selected type of msi it  
   need to build, yes before building it need to extract the zip and get all the files then harvest it for mis building.Now we  
   also need ask the user on form what type of component it is. is it .net framework based or .net core, react based, angular   
   based because  type were having different types of configuration like web.config or appsetting.json which need to be get     
  transform also. here we are using the msdeploy for transforming the config where we have stored web.setparameter.xml in some  
   other organistion application in form of Key and value and we have the access of that application API which can generate     
  the required file and by using that file from different envrionment from the api we need to create different multiple msi     
  based on envirionment sets. By using this transformation we are making the ready msi for the installtion on remote machine.\  
  \
  Lets first create the part where we will build different msi for different environments for different AppShort keys Master    
  application agsint their components.
