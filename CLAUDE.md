Components are deleted by setting is_enabled = 0, which hides them from UI while preserving database records for audit trails and data recovery. This is the approved business practice for this MSI Factory application.
- USER ROLES SYSTEM: Three-tier role system - Admin (full access), PowerUser (Technical Project Managers with component CRUD permissions), User (read-only). PowerUsers can Add/Update/Delete/Enable-Disable Components but have limited admin powers.
